An experimental grid-based halo effect built with the [TresJS](https://tresjs.org/) ecosystem. <br> <br>
üëâ [Live Demo](https://os-grid-halo.netlify.app/)

## üåÄ Technique

This demo creates a **hexagonal grid of instanced spheres** using `InstancedMesh` from Three.js.
Each sphere reacts dynamically to the cursor position:

- **Parallax & falloff scaling**:
  Instances closer to the cursor grow in size with a smooth falloff (`exp(-x¬≤)`).

- **Custom Fresnel shader**:
  A `three-custom-shader-material` fragment shader blends a **base color** with a **fresnel rim highlight**.
  The rim is anisotropic (elliptical) and modulated with procedural **noise (fbm)** for an organic look.

- **Performance**:
  - `DynamicDrawUsage` + `setMatrixAt` for efficient updates.
  - Uses GSAP‚Äôs `quickTo` for smooth mouse-driven parallax offsets.
  - Fully GPU instanced, allowing thousands of animated spheres.

The result is a **halo-like shimmering grid** that follows the mouse and reacts with fresnel-driven highlights.
